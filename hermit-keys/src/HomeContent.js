            Rent has been getting pricey in America the last few years! The
            first graph (Construction Coverage) show the median residential rent
            in each state. Our tool deals more into the gnitty gritty of each
            county to help you find the district to start your research. The
            second graph (NAR Realtor) analyzes the market cost of all homes! It
            gives you an idea of what counties will have costly properties.
